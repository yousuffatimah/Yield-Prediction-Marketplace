# 🌾 Yield Prediction Marketplace

Welcome to the Yield Prediction Marketplace – a decentralized Web3 platform built on the Stacks blockchain using Clarity smart contracts! This project addresses the real-world problem of agricultural market volatility by leveraging blockchain-stored historical yield data to enable accurate yield predictions. Farmers can hedge against risks like poor harvests or price fluctuations through a transparent marketplace for prediction-based derivatives, while data contributors and predictors earn rewards for participation.

By storing immutable historical data on-chain and facilitating peer-to-peer hedging, the platform empowers smallholder farmers in developing regions to stabilize income, reduces reliance on traditional insurance, and fosters a community-driven prediction ecosystem.

## ✨ Features

🌽 Immutable storage of historical crop yield data from verified sources  
🔮 Community-submitted yield predictions with reward mechanisms for accuracy  
💹 Marketplace for trading prediction tokens and hedging contracts  
📊 Data analytics tools for querying historical trends  
🛡️ Oracle integration for real-time weather and market data feeds  
🏆 Governance system for community-driven updates and dispute resolution  
🔒 User verification to ensure data integrity and prevent fraud  
💰 Tokenomics with staking and rewards to incentivize participation  
📈 Hedging options like futures-style contracts based on predicted yields  

## 🛠 How It Works

The platform uses 8 modular Clarity smart contracts to handle data management, predictions, trading, and governance. Historical yield data (e.g., crop types, regions, yields per season) is stored on-chain, allowing anyone to query it for predictions. Predictors submit forecasts, which are used to create tradable tokens or hedging positions. At the end of a season, actual yields are verified via oracles, and rewards/settlements are distributed automatically.

**For Farmers (Hedgers)**  
- Register as a user and stake tokens for credibility.  
- Query historical data to inform your strategy.  
- Create or buy hedging contracts based on predicted yields (e.g., "If corn yield in Region X drops below 5 tons/ha, pay out Y tokens").  
- At settlement, the contract auto-executes based on verified actual yields, protecting against losses.

**For Predictors and Data Contributors**  
- Submit historical data (verified via oracle) or yield predictions with a stake.  
- Earn rewards if your prediction is accurate or data is used in successful hedges.  
- Participate in governance votes to improve the platform.

**For Traders**  
- Browse the marketplace for prediction tokens (e.g., bullish/bearish on yields).  
- Trade tokens peer-to-peer or enter hedging pools.  
- Use analytics contracts to visualize data trends before trading.

That's it! A fully decentralized way to mitigate agricultural risks with blockchain transparency.

## 📜 Smart Contracts Overview

This project involves 8 Clarity smart contracts for modularity, security, and scalability:

1. **DataStorageContract**: Handles the immutable storage and querying of historical yield data (e.g., crop yields, weather patterns by region and season). Uses maps for efficient data retrieval.

2. **OracleContract**: Integrates external data feeds (e.g., real-time weather APIs or official yield reports) to verify submissions and trigger settlements. Ensures off-chain data is trusted via multi-signature oracles.

3. **UserRegistryContract**: Manages user registration, KYC-like verification, and staking requirements to prevent sybil attacks and maintain data quality.

4. **PredictionSubmissionContract**: Allows users to submit yield predictions with stakes. Tracks predictions in a map and enforces deadlines for each season.

5. **RewardDistributionContract**: Calculates and distributes rewards to accurate predictors and data contributors based on deviation from actual yields. Uses token transfers for payouts.

6. **MarketplaceContract**: Facilitates the listing, buying, and selling of prediction tokens (ERC-20-like fungible tokens representing yield forecasts).

7. **HedgingContract**: Enables creation of derivative-like hedging positions (e.g., options or futures) tied to predicted vs. actual yields. Auto-settles at the end of prediction periods.

8. **GovernanceContract**: Allows token holders to propose and vote on platform upgrades, parameter changes (e.g., reward rates), or dispute resolutions. Uses DAO-style voting mechanics.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To deploy and test:  
- Install the Clarinet toolkit for Clarity development.  
- Clone the repo and run `clarinet test` for unit tests.  
- Deploy contracts to Stacks testnet and interact via the Hiro Wallet.
